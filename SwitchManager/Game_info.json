Some Chambers have multiple goals, and depending on which \ngoals you reach, the game diverges into seven different routes. There \nalso exists a secret route that can only be unlocked under certain \nconditions. To clear each route you must reach the colored goal that \nappears at the end. The seven basic routes and one secret route equal a \ntotal of fifty Chambers all together for you to challenge.\n\nThe game also features original music composed by sanodg to accompany \nyou as you play throughout the game.\n\nHD rumble will also allow you to feel which direction the box extends in.",

Overcome obstacles, figure out how to collect all \nthe coins, find all the gems and remember your childhood while doing it! \nProgress through the game's dungeon through non-linear exploration and \nkeep an open eye for secrets to find.\n\nFeatures:\n\nA dungeon of 50+ rooms to overcome, each its own mini-level\n\nOpen exploration, choose which way to go, but don't worry, a helpful \nmap is just one button press away\n\nChallenging, old-school platforming\n\nCollect as many coins as you want, but we both know you want them all\n\nCoins will make you rich, but there's no escaping the dungeon without \nall the gems\n\nSecret scrolls to find for the more observant player\n\nBest of all, play the game on a selection of 7 virtual old machines, \nfrom the Pomo D'or 4, to Maple and Some Toy and all the way to the \nNS-Bos PC\n\nHeads up!The Adventures of Elena Temple is just one game you can \nplay on seven simulated machines. Aside from the different look, the \ngame plays the same on all machines and has the exact same content! The \npurpose of these old machines is to remind you of the old days, so feel \nfree to pick whichever you like best without any fear of missing out on \ngame content.\n\nI'm a solo indie developer, I loved making The Adventures of Elena \nTemple and I hope you enjoy it!

The new Burst Combo system rewards you for finishing \noff enemies and bosses up close and personal, and the Dowsing ability \ntriggers the HD Rumble function when you get close to one of the many \nhidden items/areas in the game.\n\nThe classic pixel style graphics have also been completely redone to \nblur the line between 8-bit and 16-bit and take you back to the golden \nage of 2D action games!",

A long-abandoned home for the mentally ill, recently re-opened \nby the \"research and charity\" branch of the transnational Murkoff \nCorporation, the asylum has been operating in strict secrecy\u2026 until now. \nActing on a tip from an anonymous source, independent journalist Miles \nUpshur breaks into the facility, and what he discovers walks a \nterrifying line between science and religion, nature and something else \nentirely. Once inside, his only hope of escape lies with the terrible \ntruth at the heart of Mount Massive.\n\nContinue to explore the dark world of the Murkoff Corporation with the \nincluded Outlast: Whistleblower DLC. You will play as Waylon Park, a \nsoftware engineer under contract with Murkoff and the man who emailed \njournalists around the world - including Miles - at the beginning of \nOutlast. Spending a couple of weeks at Mount Massive, during which he \nwas unable to even talk to his wife and son thanks to strict security \nprotocols, Waylon developed a deep-seated distrust of the \nprofit-motivated scientists and doctors leading dangerous and \nirresponsible experiments on their patients. Identifying with those poor \nsouls fueled Waylon's anger, and set the stage for his unmasking of \nMount Massive's rotten core. Although Whistleblower tells the story that \nled to Outlast, it will actually stretch past the events of the first \ngame to show the final chapter in Mount Massive Asylum's story.\n\nOutlast and the Outlast: Whistleblower DLC is a true survival horror \nexperience which aims to show that the most terrifying monsters of all \ncome from the human mind.\n\nFeatures:\n\nTrue Survival Horror Experience: You are no fighter - if you want to \nsurvive the horrors of the asylum, your only chance is to run... or \nhide\n\nImmersive Graphics: AAA-quality graphics give players a detailed, \nterrifying world to explore\n\nHide and Sneak: Stealth-based gameplay, with parkour-inspired \nplatforming elements\n\nUnpredictable Enemies: Players cannot know when - and from where - one \nof the asylum's terrifying inhabitants will finally catch up to them\n\nReal Horror: Outlast's setting and characters are inspired by real \nasylums and cases of criminal insanity",

The basic principle is as \neasy as applying it is complex: Exit the chambers via the exit doors. \nBut be weary of the WorkerDroids in charge of maintaining the chambers. \nThey\u2019re not exactly what you and I would call \"human friendly.\"\n\nUse the ChromaGun to colorize walls and WorkerDroids to progress in the \nchambers. WorkerDroids are attracted to walls of the same color. Using \nthat mechanic, try to reach the exit door of each chamber. Some doors \nare more complicated to use than others: They can only be opened using \ndoor triggers and only stay open as long as the triggers are occupied.\n\nIf all of this sounds like your brain can handle it, congratulations! \nYou're the perfect candidate for our test chambers!\n\nThat being said, welcome and good luck!",

It's a game that asks, what if you could \ndeform and reshape the world itself? Semblance takes the idea of a \n'platform' in a platformer and turns it on it\u2019s head. What if platforms \nwere actually part of the gameplay, part of the way you solved problems?\n\nExplore a world where the default is soft, where the property of \n'hardness' doesn't exist. Each of the game's three worlds explore a new \nconsequence of a planet that can shift, change and deform. Beat back the \nstrange, crystalline infection of hard material by freeing the world's \nlife essences and uncover the dark cause for its appearance.\n\nUnique and innovative deforming platform gameplay:Can't reach a \ncollectible? Just deform and elevate a piece of the ground so that the \npoint you jump from is higher. Nasty spikes in the way? Just deform and \npush-down the ground lower so that you can pass by. Squish, bounce, \nsquash and transform the world- and yourself to solve problems.\n\nBeautiful Minimalist Aesthetic Design:Explore 3 worlds bursting with \ncolorful minimalist charm, quirky critters, and calming vistas. Become \nhypnotized by each world's dynamically layered score, each with a hint \nof African aural distinction.\n\nExplore non-linearly:The game allows you to move between puzzles as \nyou wish, never forcing you to find a solution in order to progress and \nenabling you to come back later. Similarly, the game's narrative is \npresented expansively, allowing you to explore- and piece together the \nstory for yourself as you roam the game.",

Like \nany other perfectly normal school, its students and faculty are going \nmissing and the classrooms have been locked down for weeks. Yes, there's \nnothing remarkable happening at WFHS whatsoever - just ask the new \nprincipal.\n\nThings are bound to get stirred up when an enthusiastic, bizarrely \ndressed new kid wanders into town. This go-getter's name is Daryl, and \nhe just wants to make friends. What starts out as an innocent effort to \nhelp jump-start a young contraband textbook business turns into a \nharrowing quest through the school and its enormous, monster-filled \nclassrooms in the hope of becoming the most popular kid in town. Oh - \nand saving everyone's lives is top priority, of course.\n\nNo need to worry. There's nothing to see here at Water Falls High School.",

Of course, the space station will \ndefend itself, which is where the fun begins: the station's defences, \nwith their never-ending arsenal of weapons and artifacts, will have to \nbe destroyed. But the story gets more complicated when the hackers find \nout about their agent's hidden ties...\n\nWEAPONS: Weapons reload on the go and they never run out of bullets. No \nneed to hoard ammo for the boss battle! The various weapons can be found \nor purchased (depending on the game mode) and each one has its strengths \nand weaknesses.\n\nGHOST: The protagonist is not the android you see, but the being that \nremotely controls it: a mysterious digital ghost that can leave its \nrobot chassis, pass through doors and walls, control enemy androids, and \nuse their own tools against them. What happens if the robot you control \ngets destroyed, you ask? Then your ghost will be free to control \nsomething else, or return to your main body.\n\nUPGRADES: You can have as many as you can collect. The upgrades are \npassive, so they work without needing any special controls, and they \ndon't run out or deactivate. They come in a large assortment, from \naggressive drones to bullet improvements. Remember that the more you \nget, the more OP you are.\n\nITEMS: Devices you can use at any time. High-tech equivalents to potions \nand scrolls.\n\nGEEKIES: Spread throughout the game are hidden \"geekies\". If you find \none and activate it, something related to that geekie will change in the \ngame (not affecting gameplay)... and the challenge is to find out what \nchanges. I know, it sounds silly, but some of them are funny.\n\nSECRETS: 200 rooms have secrets in them that can be revealed by \nperforming a specific action. If you find a secret, you're rewarded with \na small permanent powerup that will make your character more powerful. \nIn addition, finding all of the secrets in each level will reward you \nwith something very special.\n\nMAP: The whole map has around 300 rooms, divided into zones. Each zone \nhas its own enemies, its own ambience, its own soundtrack, and, of \ncourse, its own boss.\n\nSTORY: The story is not to save the world, but rather to go on an \nintruiging journey wrought with humor. Not to mention all the dialogues \nand cinematics, all voiced in English.\n\nGAME MODES: Ghost has 2 game modes: \"classic\" and \"survival\". Classic is \nsimilar to a metroidvania, where the more you advance through the game, \nthe more stuff you obtain and the harder the enemies become. Survival is \ncrazier, as you get stuff much faster and you'll soon turn into a \nkilling machine, but you lose everything when you die.\n\nSKILL TREE: The RPG component of the game is found in the skill tree, \nwhere you can spend skill points to level up characters, obtaining \nspecial skills for each one. Depending on what skills you select, your \ngameplay will change in an interesting way.\n\nAnd the rest is a mystery, one that I shouldn't spoil... you'll just \nhave to discover the rest on your own.",

Some Chambers have multiple goals, and depending on which \ngoals you reach, the game diverges into seven different routes. There \nalso exists a secret route that can only be unlocked under certain \nconditions. To clear each route you must reach the colored goal that \nappears at the end. The seven basic routes and one secret route equal a \ntotal of fifty Chambers all together for you to challenge.\n\nThe game also features original music composed by sanodg to accompany \nyou as you play throughout the game.\n\nHD rumble will also allow you to feel which direction the box extends in.",

        "description": "Brawlout packs a punch with couch and online play modes, blending \nplatform fighter mechanics and traditional fighting game play into a \nstylish and fluid battle royale.\n\nRather than slow-paced defensive battles, Brawlout goes all-out with the \nlightning-fast aerobatics which platform fighters are famous for.\n\nStriking the balance between the growing competitive scene and the \ngenre\u2019s party game roots, Brawlout hopes to cater to the veteran \nplatform fighter, the casual fan and the newcomer looking to make their \nmark.\n\nEach character in Brawlout has their own unique playstyle, catering to \nspecific character archetypes seen in other fighters. Whether you\u2019re a \ndie-hard grappler or a rushdown fiend, there is a fighter for you in \nBrawlout.\n\nThere are currently six original characters and two popular indie \ncharacters to choose from that allow for varied play styles. As well as \ncosmetic skins, each original Brawlout character has three Variants; alt \nversions of the character with different stats, outfits and even new \nmoves. With these Variants, Brawlout\u2019s cast numbers 18 individual \nfighters. Find the fighter and Variant that\u2019s right for you and tear it \nup on the battlefield.\n\nCombined with familiar movement techniques like wavedashing and \nairdodging, Brawlout adds some extra mechanics seen in other fighting \ngames. The Rage Meter builds up as you both deal and take damage, \nallowing you either break combos with the Rage Burst or unleash hell \nwith the Rage Mode. The Rage Burst pushes opponents back, breaking their \ncombos and allowing players to create some breathing room at the cost of \nhalf their Rage Meter. If the meter fills, you can activate the Rage \nMode, increasing the knockback you deal while reducing the amount you \ntake.\n\nAs for modes, Brawlout has all you\u2019d expect from a normal platform \nfighter and then some. Up to four players can compete in either timed, \nstock or team battles:\n\nAll on the same device\n\nEach with their own device, without any internet connection, playing \nnearby\n\nOnline either with friends or other Brawlout players\n\nAI opponents are also available if you want to practice your team \ncombos with a friend, or if you need to fill out a free for all. Train \nwith Advanced Tutorials or go in for yourself in challenging Arcade \nTowers.",
